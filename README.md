Introduction
=========
The STM Android sensor Hardware Abstraction Layer (*HAL*) defines a standard interface for STM sensors allowing Android to be agnostic about [lower-level driver implementations](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STMems_Linux_IIO_drivers/tree/linux-4.4.y-gh) . The HAL library is packaged into modules (.so) file and loaded by the Android system at the appropriate time. For more information see [AOSP HAL Interface](https://source.android.com/devices/sensors/hal-interface.html)

STM Sensor HAL is leaning on [Linux IIO framework](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/iio) to gather data from sensor device drivers and to forward samples to the Android Framework

Currently supported sensors are:

### Inertial Module Unit (IMU):

> LSM330, LSM330DLC, LSM6DS3, LSM6DS3H, LSM6DSM, LSM6DSL, LSM6DS0, LSM9DS0, LSM9DS1, LSM330D, LSM330DL, ISM330DLC, LSM6DSO, ASM330LHH, LSM6DSR, LSM6DSO32,
> LSM6DSOX, LSM6DSRX, LSM6DSO32X, ISM330DHCX, ASM330LHHX

### eCompass:

> LSM303AGR, LSM303AH, LSM303DLHC, LSM303DLH, LSM303DLM, ISM303DAC

### Accelerometer:

> LIS2DS12, LIS2HH12, LIS3DH, LIS3DHH, LIS2DW12, LIS331DLH, LIS2DG, LIS2DH, LIS2DH12, IIS2DH, IIS3DHHC, AIS2IH

### Gyroscope:

> L3GD20, L3GD20H, L3G4200D

### Magnetometer:

> LIS3MDL, LIS2MDL, IIS2MDC

### Pressure and Temperature:

> LPS22HB, LPS22HD, LPS25H, LPS331AP, LPS33HW, LPS35HW, LPS22HH, LPS27HHW

### Humidity and Temperature:

> HTS221

Software architecture and Integration details
=============

STM Sensor HAL is written in *C++* language using object-oriented design. For each hw sensor there is a custom class file
(*Accelerometer.cpp*, *Magnetometer.cpp*, *Gyroscope.cpp*, *Pressure.cpp*, *Temp.cpp* and *RHumidity.cpp*) which extends the common base class (*SensorBase.cpp*).

Copy the HAL source code into *<AOSP_DIR\>/hardware/STMicroelectronics/SensorHAL_IIO* folder. During building process Android will include automatically the SensorHAL Android.mk.
In *<AOSP_DIR\>/device/<vendor\>/<board\>/device.mk* add package build information:

	PRODUCT_PACKAGES += sensors.{TARGET_BOARD_PLATFORM}

	Note: device.mk can not read $(TARGET_BOARD_PLATFORM) variable, read and replace the value from your BoardConfig.mk (e.g. PRODUCT_PACKAGES += sensors.msm8974 for Nexus 5)

To compile the SensorHAL_IIO just build AOSP source code from *$TOP* folder

	$ cd <AOSP_DIR>
	$ source build/envsetup.sh
	$ lunch <select target platform>
	$ make V=99

The compiled library will be placed in *<AOSP_DIR\>/out/target/product/<board\>/system/vendor/lib/hw/sensor.{TARGET_BOARD_PLATFORM}.so*

To configure sensor the Sensor HAL IIO use mm utility from HAL root folder (only for Android version up to M included)

	$mm sensors-defconfig       (default configuration)
or

	$mm sensors-menuconfig

otherwise after the initial build of Android and SensorHAL, move to SensorHAL path and load initial Android settings

	"source android_data_config"

than run make command with one of the following options:

	"make sensors-defconfig"	Set to default configuration

	"make sensors-menuconfig"	Text based color menus, radiolists & dialogs.

	"make sensors-cleanconf"	Delete hal_config, hal_config.old and configuration.h files.


For more information on compiling an Android project, please consult the [AOSP website](https://source.android.com/source/requirements.html)



STM proprietary libraries
================

STM proprietary libraries are used to define composite sensors based on hardware (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) or to provide sensor calibration

### SENSOR_FUSION:
> The STM Sensor Fusion library is a complete 9-axis/6-axis solution which combines the measurements from a 3-axis gyroscope, a 3-axis magnetometer and a 3-axis accelerometer to provide a robust absolute orientation vector and game orientation vector

### GEOMAG_FUSION:
> The STM GeoMag Fusion library is a complete 6-axis solution which combines the measurements from a 3-axis magnetometer and a 3-axis accelerometer to provide a robust geomagnetic orientation vector

### GBIAS:
> The STM Gbias Calibration library provides an efficient gyroscope bias runtime compensation

### MAGCALIB:
> The STM Magnetometer Calibration library provides an accurate magnetometer Hard Iron (HI) and Soft Iron (SI) runtime compensation

### ACC_CALIB:
> The STM Accelerometer Calibration library provide an afficient accelerometer offset runtime compensation

To enable STM proprietary libraries please use mm utility

	$mm sensors-menuconfig
